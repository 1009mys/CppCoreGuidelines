# STL: The Standard Library

Using only the bare language, every task is tedious (in any language).
Using a suitable library any task can be reasonably simple.

Standard-library rule summary:

* [STL.1: Use libraries wherever possible](#Rstl-lib)
* [STL2.: Prefer the standard library to other libraries](#Rstl-stl)
* ???


<a name="Rstl-lib"></a>
### STL.1:  Use libraries wherever possible

**Reason**: Save time. Don't re-invent the wheel.
Don't replicate the work of others.
Benefit from other people's work when they make improvements.
Help other people when you make improvements.

**References**: ???

### STL2.: Prefer the standard library to other libraries

**Reason**. More people know the standard library.
It is more likely to be stable, well-maintained, and widely available than your own code or most other libraries.

## STL.con: Containers

???

## STL.str: String

???

## STL.io: Iostream

???

### STL.???: Use character-level input only when you have to; _expr.low_.

### STL.???: When reading, always consider ill-formed input; _expr.low_.

## STL.regex: Regex

???

## STL:c: The C standard library

### STL.???: C-style strings

### STL.???: printf/scanf
