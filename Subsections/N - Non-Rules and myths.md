# Non-Rules and myths

This section contains rules and guidelines that are popular somewhere, but that we deliberately don't recommend.
In the context of the styles of programming we recommend and support with the guidelines, these "non-rules" would do harm.

Non-rule summary:

* all declarations on top of function
* single-return rule
* no exceptions
* one class per source file
* two-phase initialization
* goto exit
